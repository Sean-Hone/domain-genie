# Domain Genie

Domain Genie is a fun side project I used to learn Next.js and generative AI techniques for building postive user experience.
It's a simple application that helps people generate ideas for a domain name. They can enter a description about their
business or club and Domain Genie will come up with some possible domain names. It even checks if the name is available.

## Cool tech used

- Next.js as a full stack framework
- OpenAI Chat-GPT generative AI
- Generative AI streaming user experience
- Generative AI prompting and integration
- Rapid API integration
- Vercel KV + Upstash rate limiting
